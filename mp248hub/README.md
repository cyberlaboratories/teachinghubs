# MP248 application

This is a [cyberhub](https://github.com/cyberlaboratories/cyberhubs) application that can be deployed in conjunction with a corehub/multiuser installation. See [cyberhub documentation](https://github.com/cyberlaboratories/cyberhubs/blob/master/README.md). 

In addition to the [Python packages included in the corehub/singleuser application](https://github.com/cyberlaboratories/cyberhubs/blob/master/singleuser/single_pip3_requirements_corehub.txt) this application hub contains a few [additional packages](). 

This application is used for the [MATH248/PHYS248](https://github.com/UVic-CompPhys/physmath248-2018) class [at UVic](https://web.uvic.ca/calendar2018-01/CDs/PHYS/248.html).

Contact Falk Herwig for questions and comments and suggestions how this application can be improved, including adding packages. This can also be expressed through a fork/pull request.
