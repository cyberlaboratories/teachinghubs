    "\n",
    "In the notebooks directory: clone [course repo](https://github.com/UVic-CompPhys/physmath248-2018)\n",

    "git clone https://github.com/UVic-CompPhys/physmath248-2018.git\n",

    "Then  [according to instructions (at bottom)](https://github.com/UVic-CompPhys/physmath248-2018/blob/master/Part.I/Lab.1a.ipynb) [and here](https://github.com/UVic-CompPhys/physmath248-2018/blob/master/Part.I/2.%20Intro%20Git.ipynb), clone your own BitBucket repo. It is recommended that you set up your .ssh keys with your own repo account for easy pull/push (without having to type in your passwd).\n",

    "* **Important note:** Storage in your home directory is **not persistent** which means that when your restart your server instance (which you do not have to do often, see however below) the data in your home directory (the place you are when you type just `cd` and hit Return) is lost. The approved way to use this application is to keep a clone of the course repo with the course materials and your own repo shared with the instructors in your home dir, and `add/commit/push` frequently any work you are doing.\n",
